Migrating from CloudFormation to Terraform involves transitioning infrastructure management while retaining existing resources. The process typically includes:

1. Export CloudFormation Resources: Identify and export the resource IDs managed by CloudFormation.
2. Create Terraform Configuration: Write the equivalent Terraform configuration files for those resources.
3. Use the `terraform import` Command: Import the existing resources into the Terraform state using the `terraform import` command. This associates the existing infrastructure with your Terraform configurations.
4. Verify and Plan: Run `terraform plan` to verify that the imported resources match the desired configuration without changes.
5. Manage with Terraform: Continue managing your infrastructure with Terraform, ensuring all changes are tracked and versioned within Terraform.

This method allows you to smoothly transition from CloudFormation to Terraform while maintaining infrastructure continuity.
